I scrapped the climatestotravel website for south africa and look at the weather conditions for three costal cities. Cape Town, Durban and Port Elizabeth.
I then analyzed the data for these three cities, to gain some insights has to how the the weather is and see the overall impact the temperature has on other facts like Amount of Sunlight, Precipitation and Sea Temperature
